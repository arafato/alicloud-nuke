# ali-nuke: Alibaba Cloud Resource Deleter

`ali-nuke` is a powerful command-line tool designed to **delete all resources** from an Alibaba Cloud account. **Use this tool with extreme caution**, as it is irreversible and cannot distinguish between production and non-production resources.

**WARNING:** This tool is highly destructive. It is strongly advised **not** to run this application on any Cloudflare account where you cannot afford to lose all resources. Always back up critical data and configurations before execution.
